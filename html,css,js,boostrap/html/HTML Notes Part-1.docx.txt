 Server
A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other machines, known as clients, over a network/inet.
In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines, they are considered servers.
a server stores all the data associated with the websites that are hosted by it and shares that info with all computers and mobile devices (like yours) that need to access them.
Server provides data services to clients






Client
A client is a device that connects to and uses the resources of a remote computer, or server.
Clients may use a desktop or a laptop or a tablet or a mobile phone or a TV or a car etc.
The device which is used by the user is called a “Client”.
Client is a media between server & end-user
 
User
The person who is working on/operating a client machine is known as User or end-user.

WHAT IS APPLICATION OR SOFTWARE?
Application is an Automation process of manual business operations (human being work) by using a programming language.
 
WHAT IS WEB APPLICATION?
Web applications are network enabled applications. We can deploy any web applications in servers and we can access them over the network using server ip address and application name.
In computing, a web application is a client–server software application which the client (or user interface) runs in a web browser and it contains web documents in the form of electronic pages (web pages).
 
A web application typically contains following three layers:              
Presentation layer is a user interface (views) which are accessible from any web browser.
 
Business layer is a server-side program which is nothing but automation of business rules. Client layer will interact with the business layer to persist data.
 
Data layer is database software where we can store client related data. Business layer will interact with the data layer.
HOW MANY TYPES OF WEB APPLICATIONS WE HAVE?

Internet
The Internet stands for international networking.
The Internet is a network of connected computers. No company owns the Internet; it is a cooperative effort governed by a system of standards and rules. The purpose of connecting computers together, of course, is to share information.
 
A Brief History of the Web
The Web was born in a particle physics laboratory (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland in 1989. There a computer specialist named “Tim Berners-Lee” first proposed a system of information management that used a “hypertext” process to link related documents over a network. He and his partner, Robert Cailliau, created a prototype and released it for review. For the first several years, web pages were text-only.
 
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
World Wide Web Consortium (called W3C) is the organization that oversees the development of web technologies. The group was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the Web, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).


HTML
It is specially designed hypertext for web browsers, with meaningful tags or elements in simple English language.
 
HTML Versions
From the W3C organization there are the following versions released.
Version Specification                      Release Date

HTML introduction
1.            HTML was developed by “Tim-Berners-Lee”, released in 1993-dec/94 and maintained by W3C Org.                
         GML  ⇒           SGML  ⇒ HTML         
                            90               91                   94
 
  2.           HTML stands for “Hypertext Markup Language”.
“Hypertext” means the text that can be transferred from internet server to internet client.
"Markup" means which syntax will be in the form of tags or you simply "markup" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.
“Language” is an interface between web developer and web browser
 
3.            Technically, HTML is not a programming language, but rather a markup language.  
 
 4.            HTML is used to design "static web pages", static web pages that always show the same information.
 
5.          HTML is very easy to understand (no prerequisites).
 
6.          HTML is “client side tech”. That means the html code executes on the client browser but not on the server.
 
7.          HTML is supported by all the browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera and other browsers.                                  
              
8.          HTML is used in all real time web sites today; html is the only language available in the world for designing Web pages.
  
9. For working html no need installs any software, and browser is responsible for executing & producing output of html programs.
                       Typing & saving ⇒ notepad
                       Execution & result ⇒ Browser
 
Notepad++, editplus
                       VS Code, Sublime, Ec, netbeans
 
10. Html is error free programming.
              (while working with url/address only we will get errors)
 
11. HTML is not a case sensitive language that means you can write the html code in either uppercase or lower case.


14. HTML is an interpreter-based language. Browser interprets HTML code.
Translators: converting high level code (human) into machine level code (MP/OS) is called translation.
Who performs this operation are called translators.
Types:            compiler, interpreter, assembler
interpreter  it translates code line-by-line and executes line-by-line (interpretation)
                                       interpreter
        html code  ⇐=============⇒ machine code
        (English)                                         (Binary code)







Tag:                       
·      A tag is a keyword, enclosed within "<" and ">" in HTML language.
·      It is a special kind of text placed between the left angular brace and right angular brace(<tag_name>).
·      Tag is a predefined program, program is instructions / command to the browser.
·      Tag is used to display some specific output in the web page.
·      Browser did not identify the tag; it shows a blank page or it prints as text.
·      tags also represented as elements.
 
types of tags
in html we have two types tags, those are:
1. paired tags
⇒ Contains open tag and closing tag.               
⇒ Opening tag specifies starting point of operation/output, closing tag specifies ending point of operation/output. 
Syn:   <tagname> text </tagname>                 
            ex:          <html>  ...  </html>
                                <head> ... </head>
                                <body> … </body>
                                <script> ...  </script>
<style> ... </style>
                       <p> …  </p>               
  note: paired tags also called as body-full tags
 
2. unpaired tags
⇒ contains only open tag.
              Syn:   <tagname>             or          <tagname/>
              ex:   <br/>          <img/>   <input/>         <hr>        <link>    <meta>
⇒ Unpaired tags also called as body-less tags
⇒self closed tags




Structure of HTML
As per W3C we have to follow the following structure to design web pages (but it’s not comp).
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=”en”>  
<head>
</head>             
<body>
</body>                                      
</html>      
 
 Generally, html program contains three parts, those are:
             > Versioning section                            
             > Head section
             > Body section
 
Versioning section                       
This is providing information to the browser which version we are using in the web page/program. So, browser is interpreting code and producing output as per given specification.
Syn:              <!DOCTYPE  html  version-url>
HTML4.0:
<!DOCTYPE html public "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.0//EN" "http://www.w3c.org/TR/html3/strict.dtd">
            <!DOCTYPE html>  ⇐ use’s new version of html
strcit.dtd file (document type definition) contains definitions of tags and specifications.
html tag
The <html> tag represents the starting and ending of an html program. html tag contains two child/sub tags those are head tag and body tag.
head tag
head tag represents a non-content section (means not output) of the web page.
This information doesn't appear on the web page/in the browser (it's called as non-content), but it's used internally by the browser.
This tag is used to set icons, title, to provide some meta data (info about web app), css settings, java scripting etc...
head tag contains some child/sub tags, those are                     
            <link>,  <title>, <meta>,   <style>, <script> and <base> tags
 body tag
body tag represents content information (means output) of the web page.
this information appears on the web page/in the browser (it’s called content).
This tag is used to design UI or to display output.
body tag contains so many child/sub tags.
some of tags: p, img, h1, table, div, a, table, audio, video, input, button, form, ol, ul, li, hr tags …


 
 
 
Comment lines
⇒ Comment lines are to provide some description about our program.
⇒ Comments are not executed by browser.
Syn:
<!-- text -->








html is a collection of tags(elements) and every tag has some attributes.


how design & execute html programs
⇒ open any text editor (sw) and type program.
                notepad, editplus, notepad++, textpad, sublime, vs code, atom, coffee, ...
⇒ save that program with any name (.html or .htm) and anywhere in the system.
⇒ execution:                 
          1st Approach: goto file location, then double click on file
          2nd Approach: goto file location, then right click on file and click on open then select browser
          3rd Approach: open any browser, then goto address bar and type filename with address.
for ex: d:/siva/test.html                                 e:/test.html












Heading tags
These tags are used to print data/text in heading format.
Html provides 6 heading tags, those are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6.
These 6 tags are used to display headings in different sizes.
Six tags are paired tags and block level elements.
Syn:
          <h1> text </h1>               
<h2> text </h2>               
<h3> text </h3>
                              …
 Note: inside the body section we can repeat any tag and no of times.
 
p tag
> p stands for paragraph.
> this tag is used to display/print more lines of text (paragraph)
> its paired tag and block level.
Syn:
              <p> text or info </p>










Note:
>browser/html doesn't accept more than one space (space bar & tab key), means while designing the program we are given more space but browser prints only one space.
>browser/html doesn't accept enter key (line breaking), means while designing a program we use enter key but browser prints data without breaking line.
 
br tag
èbr stands for break line (enter key)                
èit moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line.

HTML Attributes
⇒ Attribute is a special feature/setting of a tag.        
⇒ every tag they have attributes          99%                
⇒ An HTML attribute is a piece of markup language used to adjust the behavior or display of an HTML element. For example, attributes can be used to change the color, size, or functionality of HTML elements.        
⇒ HTML Attribute is something that we use in the starting tag of HTML Elements or HTML Tags which provides extra information about those HTML Elements or HTML Tags.
Syn:
     <tagname   attribute="value"  attribute=’value’  ... >
Note:                        
⇒  values should be enclosed within “ “ or  ‘ ‘ or without quotes.
⇒ Every attribute must be separated by a space
* attributes right side of tag only
Types of attributes
⇒  general attributes
These attributes are common for most tags (99% of tags). These attributes are used to adjust the behavior or display of an HTML element, to provide extra information about those HTML Elements to the browser, to control size of element, to change alignment of element …
those attributes are:
class, id, name, style, align, action,  href, src, target, width, height, alt, title,  min, max, step, maxlength, type, checked, selected, value, readonly, placeholder, rel etc…


⇒  event attributes
An event is a notification that is triggered when something changes in the browser.
With event attributes these events are directed to JavaScript which then responds to the event.
These attributes are used to perform some logical operations.
logical operations we can perform by using JavaScript, these also called dynamic attributes.
By using event attributes From Html page we can trigger JavaScript code or we can call JavaScript functions
attributes are:
onclick, ondblclick, onfocus, onblur, onkeypress, onkeyup, onkeydown, onsubmit, onchange, oninput, onreset, onselect, onmousemove, onmouseout, onmouseover, onwheel, onload, onsubmit, onchange etc…
